Description: planttfhunter is used to identify plant transcription factors (TFs) 
    from protein sequence data and classify them into families and subfamilies
    using the classification scheme implemented in PlantTFDB.
    TFs are identified using pre-built hidden Markov model profiles
    for DNA-binding domains. Then, auxiliary and forbidden domains are
    used with DNA-binding domains to classify TFs into families and
    subfamilies (when applicable). Currently, TFs can be classified in
    58 different TF families/subfamilies.
