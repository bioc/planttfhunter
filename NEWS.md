# planttfhunter 1.13.1

This release adds two new classification schemes (TAPscan and Plant-TFClass)
and redesigns the API around a simpler workflow: 
`annotate_domains()` -> `classify_tfs()` -> `get_tf_counts()`.

NEW FEATURES

* TFs can now be classified using the classification scheme of TAPscan v4
(Petroll et al., 2025), in addition to PlantTFDB's scheme. The TAPscan
classification algorithm (tapscan_classify.pl v4.76, with rules v82 and
coverage values v11) was ported to R and reproduces the results of the
original Perl implementation. TAPscan classifications include a variable 
`TAP_class` indicating whether each family contains transcription factors 
(TF), transcriptional regulators (TR), or putative TAPs (PT).

* TFs are also classified into superclasses, classes, and families
from the structure-based classification of Plant-TFClass
(Blanc-Mathieu et al., 2024). Plant-TFClass classifications are inferred from
TAPscan classifications using a correspondence table between the two systems.
When a TAPscan subfamily corresponds to more than one Plant-TFClass family
(TAPscan's AP2, ABI3/VP1, and MADS), PlantTFDB subfamilies are used to
resolve the ambiguity; when that is not possible, all possible
classifications are reported, separated by ';'.

* PlantTFDB classifications now include both families (e.g., AP2/ERF) and
subfamilies (e.g., ERF), as in PlantTFDB's classification scheme.

* New function `annotate_domains()` to annotate sequences with the domains
used by PlantTFDB and TAPscan. It has a `threads` argument to run HMMER 
with multiple threads.

* New data sets `tapscan_scheme` (TAPscan's classification rules),
`planttfclass_scheme` (correspondence between TAPscan and Plant-TFClass),
and `tap_class` (classes, descriptions, and references for TAPscan 
families).

BREAKING CHANGES

* `annotate_pfam()` was replaced by `annotate_domains()`, which returns a
list of two data frames (`PlantTFDB` and `TAPscan`) with variables `Gene`,
`Domain`, `qlen`, `c_evalue`, `hmm_from`, and `hmm_to`.

* `classify_tfs()` now takes the output of `annotate_domains()` as input
(data frames returned by `annotate_pfam()` are no longer accepted), and 
returns a data frame with one row per gene and variables `Gene`, 
`PlantTFDB_family`, `PlantTFDB_subfamily`, `TAPscan_family`, 
`TAPscan_subfamily`, `TAP_class`, `PlantTFClass_superclass`, 
`PlantTFClass_class`, and `PlantTFClass_family`. Note that the 
classifications previously reported in the variable `Family` 
(e.g., ERF) are now in `PlantTFDB_subfamily`, and `PlantTFDB_family` 
contains PlantTFDB families (e.g., AP2/ERF). Genes assigned to more than 
one PlantTFDB family have families (and subfamilies) separated by ';'.

* `get_tf_counts()` now takes a named list of data frames with TF 
classifications (as returned by `classify_tfs()`) as input, instead of a 
list of `AAStringSet` objects. This way, domains are annotated only once,
and TFs can be counted in different ways (and filtered, if needed) 
without running HMMER again. By default, TFs are counted per PlantTFDB 
family (previously, PlantTFDB subfamily).

* Data set `classification_scheme` was renamed to `planttfdb_scheme`, and
names 'M_type', 'MYB_related', and 'LBD (AS2/LOB)' were changed to 'M-type', 
'MYB-related', and 'LBD', respectively, to match the output of 
`classify_tfs()`.

* Data sets `gsu_families` and `tf_counts` were removed, as they can be
obtained in a few milliseconds with `classify_tfs(gsu_annotation)` and
`get_tf_counts()`, respectively. Data sets `gsu` and `gsu_annotation` were
updated.

BUG FIXES

* HD-ZIP (via HD-ZIP_I/II), TALE (via BELL), and WOX TFs were never
identified, because the names of these domains did not match the names of
their profile HMMs. Such TFs were classified as HB-other.

* Trihelix and STAT TFs were never identified for the same reason.

* Genes with two B-box domains and a CCT domain were classified as both
CO-like and DBB. They are now classified as CO-like only.

* `get_tf_counts()` returned an error when species names were
not in alphabetical order, and did not reorder species metadata to match
the order of species in the count matrix.
